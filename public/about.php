    <h2 class="form-weight-bold">Hi I'm Jess and I would like to tell you more about the process of how I make some of the products in my shop.</h2>
    <hr class="mx-auto">
    <p>The wood used in their creation is cut down from trees on my family's farm. The trees that are chosen help with overcrowding, and when cut down, they provide new life. The different types of wood in my shop are cherry, white pine, hemlock, and white and red oak. Each listing will state what type it is!</p>
    <p>So here are some of the steps: First, we use a sawmill to cut trees into usable lumber. Then I measure and cut each piece of wood to the length of the product to be made. The wood is then put through a wood planer to smooth it and make each piece even. After that, I sanded each piece. Then either stain the pieces of wood or leave them in their natural color and add a clear seal to protect the wood. For the Ceiling Hang Pot Racks, Jewelry Organizers, and Coat Racks, holes are made for the hooks by drill press, and the last step is to install hooks and chain.</p>
    <p>Also note that wood has to dry from being cut down for about 1 to 6 months, so this is a pretty long process, but let me tell you, it is so worth it. I love seeing how each piece of wood has its own unique character and grain. After each sale, I canâ€™t contain my joy to have it hung up in its new home.</p>
